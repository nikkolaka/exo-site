# Website built on Yew framework to showcase NASA Exoplanet Archive
This is a project I started developing in order to learn Rust and WebAssembly.

## Current Features
- Calls IPAC at Caltech's Exoplanet API and lists all probably exoplanets with some bits of info
- Displays this in a local port

## To-Dos (in order of importance)
- Create carousel so only one planet can be showcased at a time
- Search planet by identifier or parameter
- Generalized render of planet (not accurate in the slightest)
- Comparison of planet to earth
- Zoom out feature to see stellar system that a planet inhabits
- Pretty up website with styling
